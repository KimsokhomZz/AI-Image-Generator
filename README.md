## How to Test PWA Functionality

### 1. Run the Project on a Local Server

PWA features (like service workers) require a server environment.**Do not open `index.html` directly.**Use one of these methods:

* [ ] Using VS Code Live Server Extension

- Open the project folder in VS Code.
- Right-click `index.html` and select **"Open with Live Server"**.

#### Using Node.js http-server

```sh
npm install -g http-server
http-server .
```

Then open the URL shown in your terminal (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).

#### Using Python (3.x)

```sh
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### 2. Test PWA in Your Browser

1. Open the app in **Google Chrome** or another Chromium-based browser.
2. Open **DevTools** (F12), go to the **Application** tab.
3. Check:
   - **Manifest**: Should show your app info and icons.
   - **Service Worker**: Should show as "activated and running".
   - **Cache Storage**: Should list your cached files.
4. Try going offline (DevTools > Network > Offline) and refresh.
   The app should still load (from cache).
